# Add Details about this repository

This repository contains the experimental data downloaded from UCI machine learnning repository. The data was recorded during the experiments performed for the analysis of power consumption of various appliances by the University of Mans, Belgium. The University of Mans holds all the rights to this dataset, I downloaded this dataset from official UCI repository for my own project, to create a machine learning model for predicting the appliances energy consumption.

This repository is the result of my personal interest to understand the principles and implementation of machine learning algorithms and predictive models.

`energydata_complete.csv` :: Contains the recorded data from the experiment

`DataDriven_Model.ipynb` :: Is the implementation file (jupyter notebook) containing the regression model that was used to make predictions about the comsumption of power by appliances.
